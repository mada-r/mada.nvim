# mada.nvim
I use this config with my Roblox workflow, setup and ready to use with RobloxLSP.
Other than that it's pretty basic.

### Updates

The **[Windows Branch](https://github.com/mada-r/mada.nvim/tree/windows)** is the most up-to-date version of my config. In the near future I will default the repo to have my windows config as main.
